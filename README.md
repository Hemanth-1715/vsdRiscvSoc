# RISC-V SoC Design and Fabrication – National-Level VLSI Lab Initiative

This repository documents a comprehensive, hands-on journey of designing, implementing, and fabricating a custom RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) using **Synopsys EDA tools** and the **SCL180nm PDK**. This project is part of the **RISC-V SoC Lab**, a national initiative under India’s Semiconductor Mission, aimed at empowering students and professionals with real-world VLSI chip development skills—from **RTL to Tapeout and Post-Silicon Validation**.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To bridge the gap between academic learning and industry-grade silicon design by enabling participants to:
- Design and validate custom RTL architectures.
- Integrate and simulate custom IPs.
- Perform backend physical design and signoff.
- Fabricate actual silicon through national foundries.
- Validate the chip post-fabrication on hardware.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔧 **Repository Setup & Functional Validation**
- 🧩 **Custom IP Integration**
- ⚙️ **Full-Chip Gate-Level Simulation**
- 🛠️ **Physical Design Preparation**
- 🧱 **Full-Chip Implementation**
- ✅ **Signoff & Tapeout**
- 🔬 **Post-Silicon Validation**

## 📚 Structure

This main repository provides a **brief overview and links** to detailed week-wise submodules documenting individual stages of the SoC development process.

## 🎯 Audience

Ideal for:
- VLSI and computer architecture students
- Academics and educators building curriculum material
- Aspiring silicon designers and verification engineers

## 🇮🇳 Aligned With

**India’s Semiconductor Mission** to create a skilled ecosystem of silicon designers who *don’t just simulate—but fabricate.*
